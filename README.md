# AppointmentApp

You need to Run the sql files in MySQL.
Run them i the follwing order:

1. Appointment_DOCTOR.sql
2. Appointment_PATIENT.sql
3. Appointment_TIME_SLOT.sql
4. Appointment_APPOINTMENT.sql

I have deleted the node_modules folder because of its huge size.

Run the following command to install the app dependencies:
npm install
